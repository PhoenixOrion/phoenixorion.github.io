            The story begins in Paris, where Regina Lampert (played by Audrey Hepburn) is contemplating divorcing her 
            secretive husband, Charles Lampert. However, her plans take an unexpected turn when she returns home from a 
            skiing trip to find her husband murdered, and she becomes entangled in a web of intrigue.

            Regina soon learns that her late husband was involved in a criminal conspiracy and had stolen a large sum of 
            money during World War II. Three mysterious men, Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), Herman Scobie (George Kennedy), 
            and Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass), are convinced that Regina knows the whereabouts of the stolen money. They are 
            relentless in their pursuit of her.

            In the midst of this danger, Regina encounters a charming stranger, Peter Joshua (Cary Grant), who offers to help
             her navigate the treacherous waters of deceit and danger. However, as the plot unfolds, it becomes clear that not 
             everything is as it seems, and Peter may have ulterior motives of his own.
