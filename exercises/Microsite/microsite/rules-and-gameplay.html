      <h1>Rules and Gameplay</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Basic Rules:</strong> Ultimate Frisbee is played on a
        rectangular field with clearly marked end zones. The game begins with a
        "pull," where one team throws the Frisbee to the other to initiate play.
        The offense aims to advance the Frisbee down the field and catch it in
        the opposing team's end zone to score a point.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Key Rules and Concepts:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Passing:</strong> Players move the Frisbee by passing it to
          teammates. They cannot run while holding the Frisbee and have a
          maximum of ten seconds to throw it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Defense:</strong> Defenders aim to prevent the offense from
          scoring by marking players, intercepting passes, or forcing turnovers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Turnovers:</strong> Possession changes when the Frisbee is
          dropped, intercepted, or thrown out of bounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stall Count:</strong> Defenders count aloud to ten, known as
          the "stall count," to force the offense to make a pass within that
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fouls and Contact:</strong> Players are expected to avoid
          contact and resolve disputes themselves. No referees are present in
          the game.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Spirit of the Game:</strong> One of Ultimate Frisbee's unique
        features is its emphasis on the "Spirit of the Game." This principle
        promotes sportsmanship, honesty, and fair play. Players are responsible
        for their own actions and must resolve conflicts respectfully, often
        with the guidance of "observers" if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tournaments and Leagues:</strong> Ultimate Frisbee offers a wide
        range of competitive opportunities, from local leagues to international
        tournaments. Notable events include the World Ultimate Club
        Championships and the USA Ultimate College Championships.
